# Risk Based Adaptive Authentication

The Risk Based Adaptive Authentication allows to analyse the risk of an authentication request coming to WSO2 IS. The
 current authentication request details and the historical login information stored at WSO2 IS-Analytics are considered for the analysis. Based on the risk factor the authentication process is escalated.

## Getting Started

To use the feature [Configure Risk Based Adaptive Authentication](docs/config.md) in WSO2 IS and WSO2 IS-Analytics.
